# ScreenSynth

An LCD guitar synthesizer based on the popular CRTelecaster design of the band ElectronicosFanasticos. 
<br>
There are a few differences in the models:
1. Using an LCD instead of a CRT.
2. Sound and visual systems are independant.
3. Guitar "strings" are ToF sensors instead of soft potentiometers.
